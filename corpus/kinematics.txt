# Concepts in Kinematics and Collisions

This document defines key concepts related to motion and interactions.

## Elastic Collision
- A collision in which the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved.
- In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.

## Inelastic Collision
- A collision in which kinetic energy is not conserved; some of it is converted into other forms of energy (like heat or sound).
- A perfectly inelastic collision is one where the objects stick together after impact.
- In all collisions, momentum is conserved.

## Reference Frames
- A coordinate system used to describe the motion of objects.
- **Inertial Frame (Lab Frame):** A reference frame that is not undergoing acceleration. Newton's first law holds true in an inertial frame.
- **Non-Inertial Frame (Rotating Frame):** A reference frame that is accelerating. To describe motion in a non-inertial frame, one must introduce fictitious forces (pseudo-forces).
- **Coriolis Force:** A fictitious force that acts on objects in motion within a rotating frame of reference. It acts perpendicular to the direction of motion and to the axis of rotation.
- **Centrifugal Force:** A fictitious force that appears to push a body away from the center of rotation in a rotating frame.
