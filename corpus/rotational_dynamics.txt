# Concepts in Rotational Dynamics

This document defines key concepts related to the motion of rotating bodies.

## Angular Velocity (ω)
- A vector quantity describing the rate of rotation of an object.
- Units: radians per second (rad/s)

## Moment of Inertia (I)
- A measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation. It is the rotational equivalent of mass.
- For a solid disk or cylinder rotating about its center: I = 0.5 * m * r^2
- For a point mass: I = m * r^2
- The total moment of inertia of a system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its components.
- Units: kg·m²

## Torque (τ)
- The rotational equivalent of force. A torque is a twist or turn that tends to produce rotation.
- τ = I * α (where α is angular acceleration)
- Also defined as the rate of change of angular momentum.
- Units: Newton-meters (N·m)

## Angular Momentum (L)
- The rotational equivalent of linear momentum.
- For a rigid body: L = I * ω
- For a point particle: L = r x p (where p is linear momentum mv)
- In a closed system with no external torques, total angular momentum is conserved.
- Units: kg·m²/s
